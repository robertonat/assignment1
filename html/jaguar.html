From the Native American word “yaguar,” meaning “pouncing killer,” jaguars are the only Panthera species found in the Americas. <br>
The Jaguar is Costa Rica’s only “big cat.” It can grow to over two meters in length and weigh up to 250 pounds. They are a very <br>
threatened species due to habitat loss and illegal hunting. The Jaguar is primarily found in reserves and national parks where  <br>
they are more protected. The female’s territory ranges from 2,500-9,000 acres and males can have up to 95,000 acres. Chances<br>
of seeing a male jaguar are slim. In Costa Rica, common prey includes green iguanas, sloths, peccaries, sea turtles, tapirs, <br>
agoutis, deer, boa constrictors, and monkeys. This “pouncing killer” gets its name by just that: stalking its prey then pouncing  <br>
on the unfortunate meal and breaking its neck. You can keep your eyes peeled, but you probably would never know if one was close.<br>
<br>

Keep a look out for them at our big cats exhibit. You might be able to stop their distinct coats out in the field.
