Sloths are a group of arboreal Neotropical xenarthran mammals, constituting the suborder Folivora. Noted for their slowness of<br>
movement, they spend most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central<br>
America. They are considered to be most closely related to anteaters, together making up the xenarthran order Pilosa. Sloths—the<br>
sluggish tree-dwellers of Central and South America—spend their lives in the tropical rain forests. They move through the canopy at <br>
a rate of about 40 yards per day, munching on leaves, twigs and buds. Sloths have an exceptionally low metabolic rate and spend 15 <br>
to 20 hours per day sleeping. And surprisingly enough, the long-armed animals are excellent swimmers. They occasionally drop from <br>
their treetop perches into water for a paddle. Their activity levels are so low that their fur may start to grow algae. However this<br>
sleek green coat acts a great camoflouge for the slow sloth to be protected from predators.<br>

Keep a look out for them at our tree top exhibit. If you look closely enough you might find one of them napping in the trees.
