Perhaps the most well known tropical bird, the toucan is a symbol of playfulness and intelligence that has been used quite successfully<br>
by advertisers and business owners. There are several species of birds in the toucan family, some with names like aracari or toucanet, <br>
but they all sport that large, comical bill. Why does the toucan have a bill that can be four times the size of its head and nearly as <br>
long as the rest of its body? Some say that the large and brightly colored bill is used to attract potential mates. Others suggest it is <br>
useful in scaring away predators or other wildlife that might compete with the toucan for food. Still others believe it is an adaptation that<br>
allows the toucan to reach food way out at the ends of branches that are not strong enough to hold the bird itself. Toucans are known to reach<br>
deep into tree cavities to grab eggs from other birds or to dig deeply into their own nesting cavities to clear them out, and pairs have been<br>
seen tossing fruit to one another in a courtship ritual. No matter what purpose you decide on, the toucanâ€™s bill is a very useful tool! <br>

Keep a look out for them at our rain forest exhibit. If you listen closely enough you might hear some calling out to each other.
