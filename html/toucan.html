    <p> Toucan page intro

Perhaps the most well known tropical bird, the toucan is a symbol of playfulness and intelligence <br>
that has been used quite successfully by advertisers and business owners. There are several species<br>
of birds in the toucan family, some with names like aracari or toucanet, but they all sport that large, comical bill.<br>
<br>
Why does the toucan have a bill that can be four times the size of its head and nearly as long as the rest of its body? <br>
Some say that the large and brightly colored bill is used to attract potential mates. Others suggest it is useful in scaring<br>
away predators or other wildlife that might compete with the toucan for food. Still others believe it is an adaptation that <br>
allows the toucan to reach food way out at the ends of branches that are not strong enough to hold the bird itself. <br>
Toucans are known to reach deep into tree cavities to grab eggs from other birds or to dig deeply into their own nesting cavities <br>
to clear them out, and pairs have been seen tossing fruit to one another in a courtship ritual. No matter what purpose you decide on, <br>
the toucanâ€™s bill is a very useful tool! <br>
