The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is primarily found in the forests throughout Costa Rica. Being relatively large for a cat, the spotted<br>
feline is only out grown by the Jaguar and Puma. It has large paws which have granted it the Spanish name mano gordo (fat hand). These <br>
“fat hands” allow for the cat to swiftly climb trees and cross streams with ease. The base color of its coat can be grayish to cinnamon, <br>
with black spots that form streaks on the neck or elongated spots on the body. Its tail is marked with incomplete bands. Each individual<br>
has a unique coat pattern. In the past, ocelots have been devastated by the fur traders. In the 80’s, 130,000+ pelts were sent to the <br>
United States alone. It is illegal to import spotted furs now, but it now faces habitat destruction as most of the Costa Rican cats do. <br>
The ocelot hunts prey from small rodents to iguanas and peccaries. This cat is very secretive and is not usually seen. These beautiful <br>
cats are nocturnal and sleep in trees during the day. Keep your eyes on the trees and you may see one!    <br>
