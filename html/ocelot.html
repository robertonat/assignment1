    <p> ocelots page intro<br>

The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is primarily found in the forests throughout Costa Rica. <br>
Being relatively large for a cat, the spotted feline is only out grown by the Jaguar and Puma.<br>
It has large paws which have granted it the Spanish name mano gordo (fat hand). <br>
These “fat hands” allow for the cat to swiftly climb trees and cross streams with ease. <br>
The base color of its coat can be grayish to cinnamon, with black spots that form streaks on the neck or elongated spots on the body.<br>
Its tail is marked with incomplete bands. Each individual has a unique coat pattern. <br>
In the past, ocelots have been devastated by the fur traders. In the 80’s, 130,000+ pelts were sent to the United States alone.<br>
It is illegal to import spotted furs now, but it now faces habitat destruction as most of the Costa Rican cats do. <br>
The ocelot hunts prey from small rodents to iguanas and peccaries. This cat is very secretive and is not usually seen. <br>
These beautiful cats are nocturnal and sleep in trees during the day. Keep your eyes on the trees and you may see one!    <br>
